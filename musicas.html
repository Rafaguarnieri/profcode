        <strong> Artista - The Cranberries </strong><br>
       <Strong> Música  - Linger </Strong> <br>
       <br> 
       <strong>Letra</strong><br>
        If you, if you could return, don't let it burn, don't let it fade. <br>
        I'm sure I'm not being rude, but it's just your attitude,<br>
        It's tearing me apart, It's ruining everything.<br>
                I swore, I swore I would be true, and honey, so did you.<br>
        So why were you holding her hand? Is that the way we stand?<br>
        Were you lying all the time? Was it just a game to you?<br>
            But I'm in so deep. You know I'm such a fool for you.<br>
        You got me wrapped around your finger, ah, ha, ha.<br>
        Do you have to let it linger? Do you have to, do you have to,<br>
        Do you have to let it linger?<br>
          Oh, I thought the world of you.<br>
        I thought nothing could go wrong,<br>
        But I was wrong. I was wrong.<br>
        If you, if you could get by, trying not to lie,<br>
        Things wouldn't be so confused and I wouldn't feel so used,<br>
        But you always really knew, I just wanna be with you.<br>
         But I'm in so deep. You know I'm such a fool for you.<br>
        You got me wrapped around your finger, ah, ha, ha.<br>
        Do you have to let it linger? Do you have to, do you have to,<br>
        Do you have to let it linger?<br>
         And I'm in so deep. You know I'm such a fool for you.<br>
        You got me wrapped around your finger, ah, ha, ha.<br>
        Do you have to let it linger? Do you have to, do you have to,<br>
        Do you have to let it linger?<br>        
        You know I'm such a fool for you.<br>
        You got me wrapped around your finger, ah, ha, ha.<br>
        Do you have to let it linger? Do you have to, do you have to,<br>
        Do you have to let it linger?<br>

      <Strong>  Artista - Green Day </Strong><br>
        <strong> Musica- Good Riddance (Time Of Your Life)</strong> <br>
        <br>
        <strong> Letra </strong><br> 
        Another turning point <br>
a fork stuck in the road<br>
Time grabs you by the wrist<br>
directs you where to go<br>
So make the best of this test<br>
and don't ask why<br>
It's not a question<br>
but a lesson learned in time<br>
It's something unpredictable<br>
but in the end it's right<br>
I hope you had the time of your life<br>
So take the photographs<br>
and still frames in your mind<br>
Hang it on a shelf<br>
of good health and good time<br>
Tattoos of memories<br>
and dead skin on trial<br>
For what it's worth<br>
it was worth all the while<br>
It's something unpredictable<br>
but in the end it's right<br>
I hope you had the time of your life<br>
It's something unpredictable<br>
but in the end it's right<br>
I hope you had the time of your life<br>
It's something unpredictable<br>
but in the end it's right<br>
I hope you had the time of your life<br><br>

   <strong> Artista - Red Hot Chili Peppers </strong><br>
   <strong> Música: Californication</strong><br>
   <br>
   <strong>Letra</strong> <br>
   Psychic spies from China <br>
Try to steal your mind's elation<br>
Little girls from Sweden<br>
Dream of silver screen quotations<br>
And if you want these kind of dreams<br>
It's Californication<br>
It's the edge of the world<br>
And all of western civilization<br>
The sun may rise in the East<br>
At least it settled in a final location<br>
It's understood that Hollywood<br>
Sells Californication<br>
Pay your surgeon very well<br>
To break the spell of aging<br>
Celebrity skin is this your chin<br>
Or is that war you're waging<br>
First born unicorn<br>
Hard core soft porn<br>
Dream of Californication<br>
Dream of Californication<br>
Marry me girl, be my fairy to the world<br>
Be my very own constellation<br>
A teenage bride with a baby inside<br>
Getting high on information<br>
And buy me a star on the boulevard<br>
It's Californication<br>
Space may be the final frontier<br>
But it's made in a Hollywood basement<br>
And, Cobain, can you hear the spheres<br>
Singing songs off station to station<br>
And Alderaan's not far away<br>
It's Californication<br>
Born and raised by those who praise control of population<br>
Well, everybody's been there and I don't mean on vacation<br>
First born unicorn<br>
Hard core soft porn<br>
Dream of Californication<br>
Dream of Californication<br>
Dream of Californication<br>
Dream of Californication<br>
Destruction leads to a very rough road<br>
But it also breeds creation<br>
And earthquakes are to a girl's guitar<br>
They're just another good vibration<br>
And tidal waves couldn't save the world<br>
From Californication<br>
Pay your surgeon very well<br>
To break the spell of aging<br>
Sicker than the rest<br>
There is no test<br>
But this is what you're craving<br>
First born unicorn<br>
Hard core soft porn<br>
Dream of Californication<br>
Dream of Californication<br>
Dream of Californication<br>
Dream of Californication<br>
